# Cosmology Infrastructure

For Cosmology, I use managed Kubernetes via [Symbiosis](https://symbiosis.host), which is only a fraction of the cost of EKS on AWS!

The cluster can be provisioned either via manual Terraform commands or running this project's GitLab CI/CD pipeline with the `PIPELINE` variable set to **infrastructure**.
